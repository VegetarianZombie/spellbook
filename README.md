# Spellbook for 5e  

This is a simple app that contains a listing of all the spells included with the SRD edition of Dungeon's and Dragons.

This project is meant to be a demonstration of both SwiftUI and Combine, targeting iOS 13 and above. 

## Approach

This app is designed to hold spells in a Core Data database and presented in SwiftUI views. Features such as favoriting or custom spells will be added down the road.

## Content

All spell content is contained within the [Systems Reference Document licensed](https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd) under the Open Gaming License. Spells not covered by these licenses will not be contained in this repo.
